# Data-Analysis-over-Election-Data
This repository explores over simple and effective ways to perform data analysis over datasets, perform basic functions to get insights and answers for inference.
The dataset contains a table of election details over states, constituencies, constituency type, candidate name, sex, category, party and votes he/she got.
The dataset is an excellent example where initial data analysis such as trends, important parties region-wise, vote shares and many more can be answered.
The jupyter notebook contains examples of some of those questions. Anyone can explore more with the dataset.
